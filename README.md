This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Epic Games Store dataset from 2008 to 2022. The purpose of this analysis is to explore various aspects of game pricing, release trends, and the factors influencing game performance and perceived value on the Epic Games platform. 

## Overview

In this project, I explored several key questions related to the Epic Games Store data:

1. **Factors influencing game pricing**: investigated how various features such as genres, developers, and platforms affect game pricing.
2. **Seasonality in Game Releases**: explored whether specific times of the year (seasonal trends) saw higher concentrations of game releases across different genres and developers.
3. **Impact of release date on game pricing and platform availability**: analyzed whether games released during major events or holidays were priced differently and how release timing affects platform availability.
4. **Game description length and sentiment**: examined whether the length and sentiment (positive/negative) of a gameâ€™s description correlated with its price, genre, and developer reputation.
5. **Sentiment analysis**: Used basic TextBlob for sentiment analysis on game descriptions to explore the relationship between game descriptions and their pricing strategies.

I had fun exploring this dataset and conducting analyses. I hope you enjoy the experience as well! :)
